# Principal components analysis data

Socio-demographic data was extracted from the American Community Survey's (ACS) 2022 five-year estimates. Variables were selected after an extensive literature review conducted by [Shreevastava et al.] (https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1415540), and include counts encompassing living conditions, social isolation, age, race, health, education, and transportation barriers, all of which have been found to impact responses to extreme temperatures. The table below indicates the ACS tables used to curate a zipcode-level socio-demographic dataset, where the description column explains the purpose of the columns extracted from each ACS table. Each table CSV file except for the B25040 table additionally corresponds to two additional files, one that describes the column metadata and one that describes the data collection.
